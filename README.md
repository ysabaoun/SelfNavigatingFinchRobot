Hi all,
This is a little project I made for my AP CS class. It isn't very advanced but just wanted to share it if someone wanted a refrence to build a similar project.

It works by simply selecting the surrounding angle with the greatest distance from the robot. The number of angles analyzed can be changed as well as the number of times the primary loop is run. I included a few example method calls to demonstrate different features of the program.

If you plan to run the code, please make sure to install the necessary Java libraries from the developers of the Finch robot, BirdBrain Technologies (https://learn.birdbraintechnologies.com/slpage/java-installation-for-finch/).

Peace,
  YS
